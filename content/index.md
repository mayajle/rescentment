[Since arriving at the Getty in early June, I have become deeply attuned to its smells. There’s the crisp scent of the gallery air conditioning, with notes of cleaning products and old pages. The fragrance of lavender greets me just outside the South Building, and in the Cafe, the rich aroma of carne asada tacos makes my stomach grumble. Elsewhere, I smell the wafting breezes of passing visitors’ perfumes and colognes—mixing sandalwood, vanilla, rose, and bergamot.]{.mark}

[For me, however, the most powerful fragrance at the Getty is that of the star jasmine. This white flower lines many walkways of the museum and blooms beautifully in the Garden. One Getty blog post described it as such: “This sweet-smelling flowering plant is native to eastern and southeastern Asia and can be found all over the Getty Center, not just in the Central Garden. A valuable perfume oil can be extracted from the flowers and a diluted form is often used in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai incenses. Flowering usually begins in May and continues through June.”]{.mark}[^1]

[Jasmine is one of my favorite fragrances. I love its musky, sweet scent, which unfolds in layers and soaks the air like a silky nectar. But jasmine’s meaning to me reaches further back. Back to the jasmine fields in Vietnam, maybe in Hue or Da Lat, where my grandmother and grandfather are from, respectively. Like my family, the jasmine I smell every day comes from southeast Asia. The plant was transported, likely by plane or by boat, making multiple stops, until it arrived here, at the Getty, for me to smell. Jasmine reminds me of a home that has been lost with blood and tears, and its scent takes me back there, to a place that has never been mine.]{.mark}

[The smell of jasmine at the Getty also takes me back in time, to my mother’s memory. When my brother was just a baby and I was not yet born, my parents visited my dad’s family in Fountain Valley. My mom had been reading about the new Getty Center atop a hill in Los Angeles, and she suggested that our family spend the day there. My grandparents objected. That is not for us, my grandfather said. “We want to do something that celebrates Vietnamese culture.”]{.mark}

[This project, “Rescentment,” seeks to give a voice, and a nose, to the many Asian diaspora writers, artists, and activists who have reclaimed smell as a tool to resist marginalization and empower their own communities. This publication is the continuation of the work I did last summer with Professor Belinda Kong researching the olfactory sense in literature and drafting the first chapter of my thesis. I hope that this project helps you recognize the power of scent—both its ability to hurt and to heal. And as my grandparents intended many years ago, this project aims to celebrate Vietnamese culture, for my family and for my ancestors who are no longer with me but linger in the air like traces of a scent long gone. Because to smell is to remember.]{.mark}
