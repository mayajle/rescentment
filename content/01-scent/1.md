Perhaps the most powerful and destructive nose in history is that of Empire. Under colonialism, empires have defined their own hierarchy of smells, delineating the foul and the fragrant to uplift their dominance and justify their subjugation. By othering the so-called “smelly” bodies of the subaltern, colonizers have appropriated the olfactory sense as a tool of Empire, using it to “sniff out” those on the margins. This method of othering falls under the discourse of Orientalism, or the construction of the Orient by the Occident, as outlined by scholar Edward Said. In Said’s words, “Orientalism is a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time) ‘the Occident’” (2). Specifically, Orientalism is based on an asymmetrical relationship between the Orient and the Occident, “a relationship of power, of domination, of varying degrees of a complex hegemony” (5).

I am interested in how Orientalism and scent intersect, assembling together a kind of olfactory Orientalism that naturalizes smells to either the “East” or “West” in a hegemonic manner. In particular, olfactory Orientalism conjures a stereotyped smellscape of the Orient, which perpetuates its simultaneous exotification and degradation. As such, my analysis focuses on the physical influences and imaginations of colonial power, demonstrating colonialism not only as a political and economic force, but also as a multisensory, embodied practice that elevates both the scents and senses of the powerful while alienating those of the subaltern figure and landscape.

A quintessential mode of Orientalism is that the Orient does not speak for itself, but is instead represented by the Occident. To reframe this in terms of olfaction, in Orientalist thought, the Orient does not smell for itself, but is instead smelled by the Occident. A case in point: according to historian Alain Corbin, travel accounts of the Orient by Flaubert and the likes “imposed a stereotyped image on oriental actuality.” For the Goncourt brothers of the 19th century, simply the name Constantinople “awoke in him dreams of poetry and perfumery where... all his ideas of Eau des Sultanes, pastilles of the seraglio, and the sun on Turkish backs mingled” (Corbin 199). Dan McKenzie, one of Britain's most well-known otolaryngologists, simplified further. “The East is just a smell!” he claimed. “It begins at Port Said and continued until one reached San Francisco. Few forgot the bazaar smells of India, the atmosphere of China. The first whiff of a Tibetan monastery, like that of an Eskimo hut, grips the throat, they say, like the air over a brewing vat” (qtd. in Reinartz 88). Such descriptions highlight that strong scents enveloped the Orientalist illusion, so that the Orient and fragrance became enmeshed in the minds of Orientalists. For them, to think of the Orient was to smell it too.

The relationship between smell and Orientalism may derive from a peculiar connection: scent’s reliance on orifices of the body. Namely, such openings become pertinent when considering xenophobic fears of a “boundary crisis” related to immigration. According to anthropologist Mary Douglas, “when external boundaries of the social system are perceived to be threatened, attention is paid to the orifices of the body and the bodily functions of ingestion, digestion, and excretion as symbols of entry and exit into and out of the social system” (qtd. in Lee 36). The bodily function of scent echoes such circulation, as smells are ingested via the orifices of the nostrils and also excreted from the body. Robert G. Lee puts forth language, food, and hair as so-called “tropes of boundary crisis” that fit this focus on the body’s own boundaries; I argue that scent can also function as such a trope, especially as a means of Eastern “excretion” into the “social system” of the West. Especially within the context of Asian immigration to America, and California in particular, during the 19th century, white paranoia of a boundary crisis grew. With it, attention to smell sharpened. Yet, perceptions of these “Eastern” scents varied widely. Lee argues that the arrival of Chinese settlers in California marked a turning point, as the “construction of racial difference as distant and exotic was displaced (but not completely replaced) by a construction of racial difference as present and threatening” (Lee 28). Thus, the romanticized “exotic” scents of the East could easily transform into the polluting smells of immigration, displaying the precarity of smell as a subjective sense connected to proximity.

Characterizing certain scents as threatening also worked to support settler colonialism. In fact, the colonizer strategically implemented deodorization tactics and eradicated indigenous olfactory traditions to reinforce his authority, as Hsuan L. Hsu argues in their book, *The Smell of Risk: Atmospheric Disparities and the Olfactory Arts* (154). For example, reports of India by British imperial officers disparaged the sensory landscape, especially the open sewer, and described Indians as “dirty children” (Reinartz 90). Consequently, colonies implemented toilet-training programs to cleanse and deodorize what they considered repulsive. Paradoxically, while denouncing indigenous smellscapes and olfactory rituals, colonizers simultaneously perpetuated the myth that the air and land were “empty” (Hsu 155). This belief attempted to justify the colonizers’ invasion of occupied space. Again these dual claims highlight the plasticity of olfaction, as colonizers ambivalently described the air as pungent and empty to align with their self-interest.

Such ambivalence is indicative of the irony of Empire. Namely, when it comes to olfaction, Empire projected its own infiltration of Asia onto the East by casting subaltern smells/smellscapes as the real “infiltrators.” In particular, the pervading quality of smells allowed the colonizer to abstract danger from subaltern scents, cautioning against their spread. Every denunciation of subaltern smells, every erasure of indigenous olfactory rituals, evaded the fact that the colonizer was the true invader—excreting his odors, enforcing his olfactory practices, on those he colonized. Perhaps the colonizer’s hyperfixation on policing subaltern cleanliness was also a manifestation of his affective guilt. As evident in idioms such as “cleanse your conscience,” “wash the guilt away,” or “come clean,” cleanliness has long been associated with morality and peace of mind. Thus, the deodorization tactics of settler colonialism may divulge the deeper stench of cruelty and the larger liability of Empire.

In this project, I focus primarily on Empire, paying attention to the harm that settler colonialism has inflicted via olfactory representations, but also the healing that Asian diaspora writers have gained from decolonizing and reclaiming scent in literature. At first, I argue that texts such as Sax Rohmer’s *The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu* (1913) manipulate olfactory language to perpetuate a “yellow peril” ideology and an Orientalist othering. Like many other crime fiction texts, *Fu-Manchu* encapsulates Empire’s obsession with surveillance and containment, using scent as a metaphor for social transgression. Yet, I pair Rohmer’s text with a turn to the cultural politics and environmental conditions in Hawai’i, drawing on Haunani-Kay Trask’s *From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in Hawai’i*. This work approaches smell through the perspective of a Native Hawaiian activist, inverting the Orientalist lens of *Fu-Manchu* and mobilizing scent as a device to protest against colonialism. Similarly, I will highlight the olfactory art of Anicka Yi, who uses scent to call out social injustices and cultivate empathy. I next discuss Monique Truong’s *The Book of Salt* (2003), which shares the postcolonial, reparative threads of Yi and Trask’s work. The text’s protagonist, Bình, is a Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris. While Bình is othered by scent to match his subaltern status as a queer, lower-class, Vietnamese person in France, I argue that Bình also offers a rewriting of *Fu-Manchu*’s characters and Orientalist perspective. In essence, *The Book of Salt* positions smell as healing and vital in order to disrupt Empire’s olfactory narrative.

It is Truong’s text that provides the titular inspiration for this chapter. Salt, which plays many roles in *The Book of Salt*, is a good starting point for discussing Empire. Salt has functioned as a catalyst throughout history, contributing both to Empire’s creation and collapse via salt mining, salt taxes, and salt protests, variously. In one famous example, Mahatma’s Gandhi's Salt March of 1930 employed salt to inspire mass disobedience and disempower the British Empire. Displaying a handful of salty mud in his hand, made by breaking British salt laws, Gandhi said: “With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire” (qtd. in “Gandhi's Salt March, the tax protest that changed Indian history”). Salt, therefore, holds significant weight in postcolonial studies. And salt, like smell, leaves traces. By tracking the salty and smelly stories of colonialism, this chapter confronts Empire’s shaky veneer of power.
