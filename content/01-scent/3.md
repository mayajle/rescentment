Fragrance often holds great importance to indigenous populations. In many indigenous cultures, there are no “good” or “bad” smells, as every scent is generative and essential in its own way (Hsu 171). In Hawai’i, sandalwood is sacred, not only as a source of food or tools, but also for its sweet fragrance. Sandalwood trees were once abundant throughout Hawaiian coastal regions and mountain slopes, and indigenous communities extracted their oil to create scents for perfume and medicinal purposes. Smell is also narratively significant, and Hawaiian literature associates chiefs with their scents, as smell conveys the notion that a legacy might linger (155).

This lingering quality highlights another feature of smell: it is deeply linked to memories and a sense of place. Among many indigenous populations, olfaction presents a useful means of understanding space and finding a sense of belonging. In Oceania, for example, indigenous groups use smell as a navigation tool, employing the notes of their environmental landscape to know where they are (155). Although maps are typically imagined in terms of the visual, such practices show that the olfactory sense also informs representations of space. This introduces Douglas Porteous’s concept of the “smellscape,” which, related to a “soundscape,” defines the olfactory environment perceived/understood by a person in a specific place. Porteous argues that “the concept of smellscape suggests that, like visual impressions, smells may be spatially ordered or place-related.” In this way, scent proves essential to indigenous livelihood, not only for its use in cultural practices, but also for its ability to create an affective sense of home.

Such belonging may therefore be disrupted by a changing smellscape, especially one brought on by Empire’s infiltration. As an example, the aforementioned aromatic sandalwood trees have been decimated by the deforestation and invasive species that came with settler colonialism and trade in Hawai’i. This destruction has impacted the smellscape of Hawai’i, encouraging displacement of spirit and identity for the indigenous community (156). In her article, “Scents of place: the dysplacement of a First Nations community in Canada,” Deborah Davis Jackson studies a similar phenomenon on the First Nations reserve in Ontario, which has been disturbed by the extreme pollution of chemical plants and oil refineries. She argues, “the local smellscape, while having reinforced a sense of positive emplacement on the reserve in the past, is now, because of the constant presence of toxic fumes, instilling in residents a profound sense of alienation from the ancestral landscape—a condition I call ‘dysplacement.’” Such dysplacement adds another layer to the harm of settler colonialism and capitalism. While scents act as warning signs of physical danger, indicating the proximity of toxic fumes, for example, they themselves can also inflict harm, estranging indigenous populations from their land and history. Accordingly, though certain smells conjure memories, others might also encourage forgetting. This erasure serves the colonial goal fundamentally.

Haunani-Kay Trask, a Native Hawaiian scholar-activist, is intent on remembering her ancestral history and attacking imperialism. Her book, *From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in Hawai’i*, pushes against abuses of Native Hawaiian rights and advocates for the sovereignty of indigenous peoples. Trask demonstrates the practice I label “rescentment,” “rescenting” smell to call out the cruelty and consequences of colonialism in Hawai’i. Primarily, she focuses on the pollution, filth, and contamination of Empire, reappropriating the label of “smelly” and attaching it to the colonizer in a litany of imperial exploitation (worth quoting at length):

> In colony Hawai’i, not only the cruelty but the stench of colonialism is everywhere: at Pearl Harbor, so thoroughly polluted by the American military that it now ranks among the top priorities on the Environmental Protection Agency's superfund list; at Waikiki, one of the most famous beaches in the world, where human excrement from the overloaded Honolulu sewer system floats just off shore; at Honolulu International Airport, where jet fuel from commercial, military, and private planes creates an eternal pall in the still hot air; in the magnificent valleys and plains of all major islands where heavy pesticide/herbicide use on sugar plantations and mammoth golf courses results in contaminated wetlands, rivers, estuaries, bays, and, of course, groundwater sources; on the gridlocked freeways, which swallow up more and more land as the American way of life carves its path toward destruction; in the schools and businesses and hotels and shops and government buildings and on the radio and television, where white Christian American values of capitalism, racism, and violent conflict are upheld, supported, and deployed against the Native people. (19)

In so doing, Trask inverts the logic of *Fu-Manchu* and other Orientalist texts: it is the Occident, rather than not, that stinks and spreads its “stench.” Trask also takes an environmentalist perspective, noting the toll of imperialism beyond the human, on the air, land, and oceans of Hawai’i. This differs from symbolic representations of scent in literature, as Trask instead scathingly points to a literal, physical “stench” that violently disrupts indigenous communities and their landscapes.

More recently, Maui fires devastated Hawai’i. One way to assess the damage done is through the olfactory sense. In addition to the initial burning smell, the fires left a lingering scent due to the debris and toxic chemicals that remained. “It just smells like absolute poison. It’s not just like a campfire smell. It’s just in the air. And it feels dirty to breathe,” a Kula resident said (Partlow et al.). One *Washington Post* article comments that Lahaina residents Samantha and David Dizon knew that there was a fire because “burning homes have a specific kind of plastic smell,” one they recognized from fires in 2018 (McDaniel and Sacks). The presence of such recurring and lasting toxicity speaks to a climate emergency. Not only ravaged by the fires, Native Hawaiians are plagued by the aftermath and the terrifying but likely possibility that Hawai’i will burn again.

To make matters worse, imperialism most likely lit the flame that burned Maui, as the consequences of colonialism and tourism made the environment ripe for fire. To follow one thread specifically, European ranchers introduced non native brushes such as guinea grass to Hawaii in the 18th century. These brushes have since spread rapidly, disrupting the natural ecosystem and endangering Hawai’i due to their high flammability. Building on global climate change, such imperialist disturbances stack up, implicating Empire as an arsonist. Former state legislator Kaniela Ing makes this point in “The Climate Crisis and Colonialism Destroyed My Maui Home. Where We Must Go From Here.” This essay laments the damage to Ing’s home and places blame on imperialism and how it has exploited Hawaiian land: “The disturbing silence left by the missing and the mourned souls tells of a disaster that's unnatural, shaped by the human hand—a byproduct of the dangerous dance between climate change and centuries of colonial greed.” Yet, Ing argues that native resilience is a “silver lining” despite tragedy:

> The wildfires of Maui, while devastating, have also ignited a spark in us. They’ve awakened a renewed commitment to not just rebuild, but to redefine what Hawaii stands for. This is our home, our history, our legacy. And it's our collective responsibility to ensure that Hawaii’s future is carved out of respect, understanding, and love for its past.

Ing’s staunch rebuke of “colonial greed” builds on writers like Trask, and together, their voices urge action and remind us what is at stake. Ing also draws attention to the future, noting the changes—including environmental action and Hawaiian sovereignty—that might remove the “stench of colonialism” and inspire hope.
