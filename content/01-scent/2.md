Sax Rohmer’s *The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu* serializes the story of police officer Nalyand Smith and Dr. Petrie as they target Dr. Fu-Manchu, a Chinese antagonist and blend of various tropes, such as the Yellow Peril, the mad scientist, and the emasculated Asian man. Karamaneh, the main female character and a captive of Fu-Manchu, works at first for the Chinese doctor, but she eventually and stereotypically falls in love with Petrie. Notably, Karamaneh exudes a flowery, intoxicating scent of the “East.” Repeatedly throughout the text, Smith is drawn to her smell, typecasting her as the cliché of the exotic and mysterious Asian woman. Unlike Karamaneh’s scent, however, the smells of Fu-Manchu indicate danger, as they are marked by pungency and predicated on evil. Petrie and Smith act as policemen of this stench, attempting to surveil and contain its threat. It is this shift from exotic to perilous that interests me, as it reflects how the “boundary crisis” discussed earlier might be represented in literature through smell. Thus, the ambivalent olfactory representations in *Fu-Manchu* conjure both an Orientalist fantasy and terror. In particular, the closeness of “threatening” scents displays Rohmer’s own paranoia of olfactory infiltration and suggests the error in producing the Orient as an unreal, exotic place. The imagination of the East as a distant invention then crumbles with a sniff.

Karamaneh introduces readers to scent as integral to the Asian woman and her mysterious irresistibility. Rohmer’s invention of Karamaneh is “wildly picturesque,” “dangerously lovely,” “submissive” and in need of saving by the “good” white man (Rohmer 79). As Karamaneh falls for Petrie, her love for him draws upon floral imagery and is compared to “the conjurer’s mango-tree; it is born, grows and flowers at the touch of a hand” (18). This flower symbolism derives from a Western invention of the Asian female body and the “lotus blossom” stereotype. Following this stereotype, Asian women are objectified as beautiful and submissive flowers, awaiting their domination by a Western man. As an extension of these “lotus blossoms,” Asian women exude an imagined flowery Oriental scent. For example, Karamaneh has a distinct scent that identifies her, which Petrie describes when he narrates: “A faint but most peculiar perfume stole to my nostrils, a perfume which seemed to contain the very soul of Eastern mystery” (91). In this way, Karamaneh’s beauty couples with her lovely perfume, making the scent a signal of the sexualized and exoticized Asian female body. Such a perfume, however, is always notably “faint.” For example, instead of describing the notes of the perfume, Karamaneh’s signature scent is only identified by its subdued quality, which is always “faintly perceptible” (106). Such faintness may be aptly viewed as a trope of distance, in which the “desired/ideal” Oriental woman must remain in the far away East in order to be exoticized and enjoyed by the Occidental male gaze (or in this case, olfaction). Thus, Petrie’s dialogue on Karamaneh’s perfume, “which seemed to be a part of her—which always I associated with her,” transforms when the “which” transitively refers to the East rather than her perfume, binding Karamaneh to the East inextricably and permanently.

The perceived danger, then, occurs when this Eastern scent is removed from its remoteness and infiltrates the West. Unlike Karamaneh’s non-threatening “faint perfume,” the scents of danger in *Fu-Manchu* are strikingly strong. For example, the first signs of danger are the envelopes “scented with some pungent perfume” that attracts the killer beasts (6). Smith later hypothesizes about this scent:

> In the swampy forests of the district I have referred to a rare species of orchid, almost green, and with a peculiar scent… I recognized the heavy perfume at once. I take it that the thing which kills the traveler is attracted by this orchid. You will notice that the perfume clings to whatever it touches. I doubt if it can be washed off in the ordinary way. (12)

Here, the strong orchid smell represents peril, rather than seduction, as Fu-Manchu applies it to draw in the killer. In particular, Rohmer makes use of the smell’s lasting quality as a fear tactic, drawing from Empire’s obsession with deodorization and hygiene. Similarly, Fu-Manchu’s opium den is polluted by a “heavy voluptuous perfume” (121). Even Redmoat, a fortress created with barbed wire to protect against “trespassers of any kind,” is not safe from Fu-Manchu’s odor: “The very atmosphere of Redmoat was impregnated with Eastern devilry; it loaded the air like some evil perfume” (32, 35). As evident here, scent’s ability to traverse the barriers of Redmoat makes it particularly alarming to the narrator. By constantly hybridizing and blurring boundaries, smell poses a unique threat to spatial and social segregation. Moreover, the role of smell itself becomes unclear, negotiating a position between the “exotic” scent of Karamaneh and the “pollutant” scent of Fu Manchu. This dichotomy ultimately reflects the larger push and pull of Western interest in and fear of the East; while Westerners may be close enough to appreciate Oriental "exoticism," they stay far enough away to evade its "peril."

Here, the roles of Petrie and Smith materialize: they are enforcers who “contain” the racialized Asian body from spreading its simultaneously dangerous/lovely scent (43). In this way, *Fu-Manchu* builds on the larger genre of detective/crime fiction and its construction of scent. In crime fiction, smell often acts as the most perceptible quality of an invisible, imminent danger. Canonical texts of the genre, such as Arthur Conan Doyle’s *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, employ dogs and their hyperosmic sensitivity to track down criminals. As Hsu notes in *The Smell of Risk*, such sniffer dogs recall the bloodhounds used to track enslaved peoples attempting to escape (32). With this in mind, Hsu argues that detectives in literature often work towards a “project of racial deodorization,” highlighting scent as a marker that may be tracked in order to target racial minorities (129). This view of detective fiction expands policing to the olfactory realm, acknowledging that the surveillance state, typically thought of in terms of the ocular and aural, engages in multisensory control. More than simply a “private eye,” detectives also mobilize the nose as a method of detection, sniffing out racial/cultural difference in the case of *Fu-Manchu*.

Overall, Rohmer outlines several olfactory tropes to uphold Orientalism, including stereotypes of the seductive smell of Asian women and the threatening scent of the Yellow Peril. Told from Petrie’s perspective, *Fu-Manchu* also imagines the East/West relationship in a typically Orientalist way, as the “Eastern” characters of Karamaneh and Fu-Manchu are always smelled by others—we do not know what they smell, or what they think about those smells. Thus, not only are the text’s Asian characters othered by scent, but they are also denied olfactory subjectivity. Herein lies the importance of learning about scent from the perspective of those on the margins.
