I am so grateful for the entire staff at Getty Publications, who welcomed me into the department and provided me with valuable lessons, thoughtful conversations, and yummy snacks during Tea at 3. Thank you very much to my supervisors, Erin Dunigan and Darryl Oliver, for their kindness. During my interview, they asked me what makes a good mentor, and I think they both have truly embodied the answer. Thank you also to Layla, who has been a source of support and a lovely friend throughout our internship. Thank you to the Goldsmith Adams Research Fund and the Office of Student Fellowships and Research at Bowdoin for making this research possible. Also, a huge thank you to my mentor and research advisor, Belinda, for all the encouragement, insights, and shared sashimi along the way. Lastly, thank you to my family, whose stories inspired this project and whose love has nourished it throughout.
