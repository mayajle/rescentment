                  Since arriving at the Getty in early June, I have become
                  deeply attuned to its smells. There’s the crisp scent of the
                  gallery air conditioning, with notes of cleaning products and
                  old pages. The fragrance of lavender waits just outside the
                  South Building, and in the Cafe, the rich aroma of carne asada
                  tacos makes my stomach grumble. Elsewhere, I smell the wafting
                  breezes of passing visitors’ perfumes and colognes—mixing
                  sandalwood, vanilla, rose, and bergamot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">For me, however, the most powerful fragrance at the Getty
                    is that of the star jasmine. This white flower lines many
                    walkways of the museum and blooms beautifully in the Garden.
                    One Getty blog post described it as such: “This
                    sweet-smelling flowering plant is native to eastern and
                    southeastern Asia and can be found all over the Getty
                    Center, not just in the Central Garden. A valuable perfume
                    oil can be extracted from the flowers and a diluted form is
                    often used in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai incenses.
                    Flowering usually begins in May and continues through
                    June.”</span><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-data-getty-fn1" id="page-data-getty-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  <span class="mark">The smell of jasmine is one of my favorite fragrances. I
                    love its musky, sweet scent, which unfolds in layers and
                    soaks the air like a silky nectar. But jasmine’s meaning to
                    me reaches further back. Back to the jasmine fields in
                    Vietnam, maybe in Hue or Da Lat, where my grandmother and
                    grandfather are from, respectively. The flower, like my
                    family, has survived a difficult journey from Southeast Asia
                    to Southern California. Somehow, we have both ended up here,
                    at the Getty. Seeing jasmine here reminds me of a home that
                    has been lost with blood and tears, and smelling it takes me
                    back there, to a place that has never been mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">The smell of jasmine at the Getty also takes me back in
                    time, to my mother’s memory. When my brother was just a baby
                    and I was not yet born, my parents visited my dad’s family
                    in Fountain Valley. My mom had been reading about the new
                    Getty Center atop a hill in Los Angeles, and she suggested
                    that our family spend the day there. My grandparents
                    objected. That is not for us, my grandfather said. “We want
                    to do something that celebrates Vietnamese culture.”</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">This project, “Rescentment,” seeks to give a voice, and a
                    nose, to the many Asian diaspora writers, artists, and
                    activists who have reclaimed smell as a tool to resist
                    marginalization and empower their own communities. This
                    publication is the continuation of the work I did last
                    summer with Professor Belinda Kong researching the olfactory
                    sense in literature and drafting the first chapter of my
                    thesis. I hope that this project helps you recognize the
                    power of scent—both its ability to hurt and to heal. And as
                    my grandparents intended many years ago, this project aims
                    to celebrate Vietnamese culture, for my family and for my
                    ancestors who are no longer with me but linger in the air
                    like traces of a scent long gone. Because to smell is to
                    remember.</span>

                  Perhaps the most powerful and destructive nose in history is
                  that of Empire. Under colonialism, empires have defined their
                  own hierarchy of smells, delineating the foul and the fragrant
                  to uplift their dominance and rationalize their subjugation.
                  By othering the so-called “smelly” bodies of the subaltern,
                  colonizers have appropriated the olfactory sense as a tool of
                  Empire, using it to “sniff out” those on the margins. This
                  method of othering falls under the discourse of Orientalism,
                  or the construction of the Orient by the Occident, as outlined
                  by scholar Edward Said. In Said’s words, “Orientalism is a
                  style of thought based upon an ontological and epistemological
                  distinction made between ‘the Orient’ and (most of the time)
                  ‘the Occident’” (2). Specifically, Orientalism is based on an
                  asymmetrical relationship between the Orient and the Occident,
                  “a relationship of power, of domination, of varying degrees of
                  a complex hegemony” (5).

                <p>
                  I am interested in how Orientalism and scent intersect,
                  assembling together a kind of olfactory Orientalism that
                  naturalizes smells to either the “East” or “West” in a
                  hegemonic manner. In particular, olfactory Orientalism
                  conjures a stereotyped smellscape of the Orient, which
                  perpetuates its simultaneous exotification and degradation. As
                  such, my analysis focuses on the physical influences and
                  imaginations of colonial power, demonstrating colonialism not
                  only as a political and economic force, but also as a
                  multisensory, embodied practice that elevates both the scents
                  and senses of the powerful while alienating those of the
                  subaltern figure and landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A quintessential mode of Orientalism is that the Orient does
                  not speak for itself, but is instead represented by the
                  Occident. To reframe this in terms of olfaction, in
                  Orientalist thought, the Orient does not smell for itself, but
                  is instead smelled by the Occident. A case in point: according
                  to historian Alain Corbin, travel accounts of the Orient by
                  Flaubert and the likes “imposed a stereotyped image on
                  oriental actuality.” For the Goncourt brothers of the 19th
                  century, simply the name Constantinople “awoke in him dreams
                  of poetry and perfumery where… all his ideas of Eau des
                  Sultanes, pastilles of the seraglio, and the sun on Turkish
                  backs mingled” (Corbin 199). Dan McKenzie, one of Britain’s
                  most well-known otolaryngologists, simplified further. “The
                  East is just a smell!” he claimed. “It begins at Port Said and
                  continued until one reached San Francisco. Few forgot the
                  bazaar smells of India, the atmosphere of China. The first
                  whiff of a Tibetan monastery, like that of an Eskimo hut,
                  grips the throat, they say, like the air over a brewing vat”
                  (qtd. in Reinartz 88). Such descriptions highlight that strong
                  scents enveloped the Orientalist illusion, so that the Orient
                  and fragrance became enmeshed in the minds of Orientalists.
                  For them, to think of the Orient was to smell it too.

                  The relationship between smell and Orientalism may derive from
                  a peculiar connection: scent’s reliance on orifices of the
                  body. Namely, such openings become pertinent when considering
                  xenophobic fears of a “boundary crisis” related to
                  immigration. According to anthropologist Mary Douglas, “when
                  external boundaries of the social system are perceived to be
                  threatened, attention is paid to the orifices of the body and
                  the bodily functions of ingestion, digestion, and excretion as
                  symbols of entry and exit into and out of the social system”
                  (qtd. in Lee 36). The bodily function of scent echoes such
                  circulation, as smells are ingested via the orifices of the
                  nostrils and also excreted from the body. Robert G. Lee puts
                  forth language, food, and hair as so-called “tropes of
                  boundary crisis” that fit this focus on the body’s own
                  boundaries; I argue that scent can also function as such a
                  trope, especially as a means of Eastern “excretion” into the
                  “social system” of the West. Within the context of Asian
                  immigration to America, and California in particular, during
                  the 19th century, white paranoia of a boundary crisis grew.
                  With it, attention to smell sharpened. Yet, perceptions of
                  these “Eastern” scents varied widely. Lee argues that the
                  arrival of Chinese settlers in California marked a turning
                  point, as the “construction of racial difference as distant
                  and exotic was displaced (but not completely replaced) by a
                  construction of racial difference as present and threatening”
                  (Lee 28). Thus, the romanticized “exotic” scents of the East
                  could easily transform into the polluting smells of
                  immigration, displaying the precarity of smell as a subjective
                  sense connected to proximity.

                  Characterizing certain scents as threatening also worked to
                  support settler colonialism. In fact, the colonizer
                  strategically implemented deodorization tactics and eradicated
                  indigenous olfactory traditions to reinforce his authority, as
                  Hsuan L. Hsu argues in their book,
                  <em>The Smell of Risk: Atmospheric Disparities and the
                    Olfactory Arts</em>
                  (154). For example, reports of India by British imperial
                  officers disparaged the sensory landscape, especially the open
                  sewer, and described Indians as “dirty children” (Reinartz
                  90). Consequently, colonies implemented toilet-training
                  programs to cleanse and deodorize what they considered
                  repulsive. Paradoxically, while denouncing indigenous
                  smellscapes and olfactory rituals, colonizers simultaneously
                  perpetuated the myth that the air and land were “empty” (Hsu
                  155). This belief attempted to justify the colonizers’
                  invasion of occupied space. Again these dual claims highlight
                  the plasticity of olfaction, as colonizers ambivalently
                  described the air as pungent and empty to align with their
                  self-interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such ambivalence is indicative of the irony of Empire. Namely,
                  when it comes to olfaction, Empire projected its own
                  infiltration of Asia onto the East by casting subaltern
                  smells/smellscapes as the real “infiltrators.” In particular,
                  the pervading quality of smells allowed the colonizer to
                  abstract danger from subaltern scents, cautioning against
                  their spread. Every denunciation of subaltern smells, every
                  erasure of indigenous olfactory rituals, evaded the fact that
                  the colonizer was the true invader—excreting his odors,
                  enforcing his olfactory practices, on those he colonized.
                  Perhaps the colonizer’s hyperfixation on policing subaltern
                  cleanliness was also a manifestation of his affective guilt.
                  As evident in idioms such as “cleanse your conscience,” “wash
                  the guilt away,” or “come clean,” cleanliness has long been
                  associated with morality and peace of mind. Thus, the
                  deodorization tactics of settler colonialism may divulge the
                  deeper stench of cruelty and the larger liability of Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this project, I focus primarily on Empire, paying attention
                  to the harm that settler colonialism has inflicted via
                  olfactory representations, but also the healing that Asian
                  diaspora writers have gained from decolonizing and reclaiming
                  scent in literature. At first, I argue that texts such as Sax
                  Rohmer’s <em>The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu</em> (1913)
                  manipulate olfactory language to perpetuate a “yellow peril”
                  ideology and an Orientalist othering. Like many other crime
                  fiction texts, <em>Fu-Manchu</em> encapsulates Empire’s
                  obsession with surveillance and containment, using scent as a
                  metaphor for social transgression. Yet, I pair Rohmer’s text
                  with a turn to the cultural politics and environmental
                  conditions in Hawai’i, drawing on Haunani-Kay Trask’s
                  <em>From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in
                    Hawai’i</em>. This work approaches smell through the perspective of a
                  Native Hawaiian activist, inverting the Orientalist lens of
                  <em>Fu-Manchu</em> and mobilizing scent as a device to protest
                  against colonialism. Similarly, I will highlight the olfactory
                  art of Anicka Yi, who uses scent to call out social injustices
                  and cultivate empathy. I next discuss Monique Truong’s
                  <em>The Book of Salt</em> (2003), which shares the
                  postcolonial, reparative threads of Yi and Trask’s work. The
                  text’s protagonist, Bình, is a Vietnamese cook who works for
                  Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in Paris. While Bình is
                  othered by scent to match his subaltern status as a queer,
                  lower-class, Vietnamese person in France, I argue that Bình
                  also offers a rewriting of <em>Fu-Manchu</em>’s characters and
                  Orientalist perspective. In essence,
                  <em>The Book of Salt</em> positions smell as healing and vital
                  in order to disrupt Empire’s olfactory narrative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is Truong’s text that provides the titular inspiration for
                  this chapter. Salt, which plays many roles in
                  <em>The Book of Salt</em>, is a good starting point for
                  discussing Empire. Salt has functioned as a catalyst
                  throughout history, contributing both to Empire’s creation and
                  collapse via salt mining, salt taxes, and salt protests,
                  variously. In one famous example, Mahatma’s Gandhi’s Salt
                  March of 1930 employed salt to inspire mass disobedience and
                  disempower the British Empire. Displaying a handful of salty
                  mud in his hand, made by breaking British salt laws, Gandhi
                  said: “With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British
                  Empire” (qtd. in “Gandhi’s Salt March, the tax protest that
                  changed Indian history”). Salt, therefore, holds significant
                  weight in postcolonial studies. And salt, like smell, leaves
                  traces. By tracking the salty and smelly stories of
                  colonialism, this chapter confronts Empire’s shaky veneer of
                  power.

                  Sax Rohmer’s <em>The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu</em> serializes
                  the story of police officer Nalyand Smith and Dr. Petrie as
                  they target Dr. Fu-Manchu, a Chinese antagonist and blend of
                  various tropes, such as the Yellow Peril, the mad scientist,
                  and the emasculated Asian man. Karamaneh, the main female
                  character and a captive of Fu-Manchu, works at first for the
                  Chinese doctor, but she eventually and stereotypically falls
                  in love with Petrie. Notably, Karamaneh exudes a flowery,
                  intoxicating scent of the “East.” Repeatedly throughout the
                  text, Smith is drawn to her smell, typecasting her as the
                  cliché of the exotic and mysterious Asian woman. Unlike
                  Karamaneh’s scent, however, the smells of Fu-Manchu indicate
                  danger, as they are marked by pungency and predicated on evil.
                  Petrie and Smith act as policemen of this stench, attempting
                  to surveil and contain its threat. It is this shift from
                  exotic to perilous that interests me, as it reflects how the
                  “boundary crisis” discussed earlier might be represented in
                  literature through smell. Thus, the ambivalent olfactory
                  representations in <em>Fu-Manchu</em> conjure both an
                  Orientalist fantasy and terror. In particular, the closeness
                  of “threatening” scents displays Rohmer’s own paranoia of
                  olfactory infiltration and suggests the error in producing the
                  Orient as an unreal, exotic place. The imagination of the East
                  as a distant invention then crumbles with a sniff.

                  Karamaneh introduces readers to scent as integral to the Asian
                  woman and her mysterious irresistibility. Rohmer’s invention
                  of Karamaneh is “wildly picturesque,” “dangerously lovely,”
                  “submissive” and in need of saving by the “good” white man
                  (Rohmer 79). As Karamaneh falls for Petrie, her love for him
                  draws upon floral imagery and is compared to “the conjurer’s
                  mango-tree; it is born, grows and flowers at the touch of a
                  hand” (18). This flower symbolism derives from a Western
                  invention of the Asian female body and the “lotus blossom”
                  stereotype. Following this stereotype, Asian women are
                  objectified as beautiful and submissive flowers, awaiting
                  their domination by a Western man. As an extension of these
                  “lotus blossoms,” Asian women exude an imagined flowery
                  Oriental scent. For example, Karamaneh has a distinct scent
                  that identifies her, which Petrie describes when he narrates:
                  “A faint but most peculiar perfume stole to my nostrils, a
                  perfume which seemed to contain the very soul of Eastern
                  mystery” (91). In this way, Karamaneh’s beauty couples with
                  her lovely perfume, making the scent a signal of the
                  sexualized and exoticized Asian female body. Such a perfume,
                  however, is always notably “faint.” For example, instead of
                  describing the notes of the perfume, Karamaneh’s signature
                  scent is only identified by its subdued quality, which is
                  always “faintly perceptible” (106). Such faintness may be
                  aptly viewed as a trope of distance, in which the
                  “desired/ideal” Oriental woman must remain in the far away
                  East in order to be exoticized and enjoyed by the Occidental
                  male gaze (or in this case, olfaction). Thus, Petrie’s
                  dialogue on Karamaneh’s perfume, “which seemed to be a part of
                  her—which always I associated with her,” transforms when the
                  “which” transitively refers to the East rather than her
                  perfume, binding Karamaneh to the East inextricably and
                  permanently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The perceived danger, then, occurs when this Eastern scent is
                  removed from its remoteness and infiltrates the West. Unlike
                  Karamaneh’s non-threatening “faint perfume,” the scents of
                  danger in <em>Fu-Manchu</em> are strikingly strong. For
                  example, the first signs of danger are the envelopes “scented
                  with some pungent perfume” that attracts the killer beasts
                  (6). Smith later hypothesizes about this scent:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In the swampy forests of the district I have referred to a
                    rare species of orchid, almost green, and with a peculiar
                    scent… I recognized the heavy perfume at once. I take it
                    that the thing which kills the traveler is attracted by this
                    orchid. You will notice that the perfume clings to whatever
                    it touches. I doubt if it can be washed off in the ordinary
                    way. (12)
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Here, the strong orchid smell represents peril, rather than
                  seduction, as Fu-Manchu applies it to draw in the killer. In
                  particular, Rohmer makes use of the smell’s lasting quality as
                  a fear tactic, drawing from Empire’s obsession with
                  deodorization and hygiene. Similarly, Fu-Manchu’s opium den is
                  polluted by a “heavy voluptuous perfume” (121). Even Redmoat,
                  a fortress created with barbed wire to protect against
                  “trespassers of any kind,” is not safe from Fu-Manchu’s odor:
                  “The very atmosphere of Redmoat was impregnated with Eastern
                  devilry; it loaded the air like some evil perfume” (32, 35).
                  As evident here, scent’s ability to traverse the barriers of
                  Redmoat makes it particularly alarming to the narrator. By
                  constantly hybridizing and blurring boundaries, smell poses a
                  unique threat to spatial and social segregation. Moreover, the
                  role of smell itself becomes unclear, negotiating a position
                  between the “exotic” scent of Karamaneh and the “pollutant”
                  scent of Fu Manchu. This dichotomy ultimately reflects the
                  larger push and pull of Western interest in and fear of the
                  East; while Westerners may be close enough to appreciate
                  Oriental “exoticism,” they stay far enough away to evade its

                  Here, the roles of Petrie and Smith materialize: they are
                  enforcers who “contain” the racialized Asian body from
                  spreading its simultaneously dangerous/lovely scent (43). In
                  this way, <em>Fu-Manchu</em> builds on the larger genre of
                  detective/crime fiction and its construction of scent. In
                  crime fiction, smell often acts as the most perceptible
                  quality of an invisible, imminent danger. Canonical texts of
                  the genre, such as Arthur Conan Doyle’s
                  <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em>, employ dogs and
                  their hyperosmic sensitivity to track down criminals. As Hsu
                  notes in <em>The Smell of Risk</em>, such sniffer dogs recall
                  the bloodhounds used to track enslaved peoples attempting to
                  escape (32). With this in mind, Hsu argues that detectives in
                  literature often work towards a “project of racial
                  deodorization,” highlighting scent as a marker that may be
                  tracked in order to target racial minorities (129). This view
                  of detective fiction expands policing to the olfactory realm,
                  acknowledging that the surveillance state, typically thought
                  of in terms of the ocular and aural, engages in multisensory
                  control. More than simply a “private eye,” detectives also
                  mobilize the nose as a method of detection, sniffing out
                  racial/cultural difference in the case of <em>Fu-Manchu</em>.

                  Overall, Rohmer outlines several olfactory tropes to uphold
                  Orientalism, including stereotypes of the seductive smell of
                  Asian women and the threatening scent of the Yellow Peril.
                  Told from Petrie’s perspective, <em>Fu-Manchu</em> also
                  imagines the East/West relationship in a typically Orientalist
                  way, as the “Eastern” characters of Karamaneh and Fu-Manchu
                  are always smelled by others—we do not know what they smell,
                  or what they think about those smells. Thus, not only are the
                  text’s Asian characters othered by scent, but they are also
                  denied olfactory subjectivity. Herein lies the importance of
                  learning about scent from the perspective of those on the
                  margins.

                  Fragrance often holds great importance to indigenous
                  populations. In many indigenous cultures, there are no “good”
                  or “bad” smells, as every scent is generative and essential in
                  its own way (Hsu 171). In Hawaii, for example, sandalwood is
                  sacred, not only as a source of food or tools, but also for
                  its sweet fragrance. Sandalwood trees were once abundant
                  throughout Hawaiian coastal regions and mountain slopes, and
                  the indigenous community extracted their oil to create scents
                  for perfume and medicinal purposes. Smells, like that of
                  sandalwood, are also narratively significant: Hawaiian
                  literature associates chiefs with their scents, as smell
                  conveys the notion that a legacy might linger (155).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This lingering quality highlights another feature of smell: it
                  is deeply linked to memories and a sense of place. In Oceania,
                  for example, indigenous groups use smell as a navigation tool,
                  employing the notes of their environmental landscape to know
                  where they are (155). Although maps are typically imagined in
                  terms of the visual, such practices show that the olfactory
                  sense also informs representations of space. This introduces
                  Douglas Porteous’s concept of the “smellscape,” which, related
                  to a “soundscape,” defines the olfactory environment
                  perceived/understood by a person in a specific place. Porteous
                  argues that “the concept of smellscape suggests that, like
                  visual impressions, smells may be spatially ordered or
                  place-related.” In this way, scent proves essential to
                  indigenous livelihood, not only for its use in cultural
                  practices, but also for its ability to create an affective
                  sense of home and belonging.

                  Such belonging may therefore be disrupted by a changing
                  smellscape, especially one brought on by Empire’s
                  infiltration. As an example, the aforementioned aromatic
                  sandalwood trees have been decimated by the deforestation and
                  invasive species that came with settler colonialism and trade
                  in Hawaii. This destruction has impacted the smellscape of
                  Hawaii, encouraging displacement of spirit and identity for
                  the indigenous community (156). In her article, “Scents of
                  place: the dysplacement of a First Nations community in
                  Canada,” Deborah Davis Jackson studies a similar phenomenon on
                  the First Nations reserve in Ontario, which has been disturbed
                  by the extreme pollution of chemical plants and oil
                  refineries. She argues, “the local smellscape, while having
                  reinforced a sense of positive emplacement on the reserve in
                  the past, is now, because of the constant presence of toxic
                  fumes, instilling in residents a profound sense of alienation
                  from the ancestral landscape—a condition I call
                  ‘dysplacement.’” Such dysplacement adds another layer to the
                  harm of settler colonialism and capitalism. While scents act
                  as warning signs of physical danger, indicating the proximity
                  of toxic fumes, for example, they themselves can also inflict
                  harm, estranging indigenous populations from their land and
                  history. Accordingly, though certain smells conjure memories,
                  others might also encourage forgetting. This erasure serves
                  the colonial goal fundamentally.

                  Haunani-Kay Trask, a Native Hawaiian scholar-activist, is
                  intent on remembering her ancestral history and attacking
                  imperialism. Her book,
                  <em>From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in
                    Hawai’i</em>, pushes against abuses of Native Hawaiian rights and
                  advocates for the sovereignty of indigenous peoples. Trask
                  demonstrates the practice I label “rescentment,” “rescenting”
                  smell to call out the cruelty and consequences of colonialism
                  in Hawai’i. Primarily, she focuses on the pollution, filth,
                  and contamination of Empire, reappropriating the label of
                  “smelly” and attaching it to the colonizer in a litany of
                  imperial exploitation (worth quoting at length):

                    In colony Hawai’i, not only the cruelty but the stench of
                    colonialism is everywhere: at Pearl Harbor, so thoroughly
                    polluted by the American military that it now ranks among
                    the top priorities on the Environmental Protection Agency’s
                    superfund list; at Waikiki, one of the most famous beaches
                    in the world, where human excrement from the overloaded
                    Honolulu sewer system floats just off shore; at Honolulu
                    International Airport, where jet fuel from commercial,
                    military, and private planes creates an eternal pall in the
                    still hot air; in the magnificent valleys and plains of all
                    major islands where heavy pesticide/herbicide use on sugar
                    plantations and mammoth golf courses results in contaminated
                    wetlands, rivers, estuaries, bays, and, of course,
                    groundwater sources; on the gridlocked freeways, which
                    swallow up more and more land as the American way of life
                    carves its path toward destruction; in the schools and
                    businesses and hotels and shops and government buildings and
                    on the radio and television, where white Christian American
                    values of capitalism, racism, and violent conflict are
                    upheld, supported, and deployed against the Native people.

                  In so doing, Trask inverts the logic of <em>Fu-Manchu</em> and
                  other Orientalist texts: it is the Occident, rather than not,
                  that stinks and spreads its “stench.” Trask also takes an
                  environmentalist perspective, noting the toll of imperialism
                  beyond the human, on the air, land, and oceans of Hawai’i.
                  This differs from symbolic representations of scent in
                  literature, as Trask instead scathingly points to a literal,
                  physical “stench” that violently disrupts indigenous
                  communities and their landscapes.

                  More recently, Maui fires devastated Hawaii. One way to assess
                  the damage done is through the olfactory sense. In addition to
                  the initial burning smell, the fires left a lingering scent
                  due to the debris and toxic chemicals that remained. “It just
                  smells like absolute poison. It’s not just like a campfire
                  smell. It’s just in the air. And it feels dirty to breathe,” a
                  Kula resident said (Partlow et al.). One
                  <em>Washington Post</em> article comments that Lahaina
                  residents Samantha and David Dizon knew that there was a fire
                  because “burning homes have a specific kind of plastic smell,”
                  one they recognized from fires in 2018 (McDaniel and Sacks).
                  The presence of such recurring and lasting toxicity speaks to
                  a climate emergency. Not only ravaged by the fires, Native
                  Hawaiians are plagued by the aftermath and the terrifying but
                  likely possibility that Hawai’i will burn again.

                  To make matters worse, imperialism most likely lit the flame
                  that burned Maui, as the consequences of colonialism and
                  tourism made the environment ripe for fire. To follow one
                  thread specifically, European ranchers introduced non native
                  brushes such as guinea grass to Hawaii in the 18th century.
                  These brushes have since spread rapidly, disrupting the
                  natural ecosystem and endangering Hawai’i due to their high
                  flammability. Building on global climate change, such
                  imperialist disturbances stack up, implicating Empire as an
                  arsonist. Former state legislator Kaniela Ing makes this point
                  in “The Climate Crisis and Colonialism Destroyed My Maui Home.
                  Where We Must Go From Here.” This essay laments the damage to
                  Ing’s home and places blame on imperialism and how it has
                  exploited Hawaiian land: “The disturbing silence left by the
                  missing and the mourned souls tells of a disaster that’s
                  unnatural, shaped by the human hand—a byproduct of the
                  dangerous dance between climate change and centuries of
                  colonial greed.” Yet, Ing argues that native resilience is a
                  “silver lining” despite tragedy:

                    The wildfires of Maui, while devastating, have also ignited
                    a spark in us. They’ve awakened a renewed commitment to not
                    just rebuild, but to redefine what Hawaii stands for. This
                    is our home, our history, our legacy. And it’s our

                  Ing’s staunch rebuke of “colonial greed” builds on writers
                  like Trask, and together, their voices urge action and remind
                  us what is at stake. Ing also draws attention to the future,
                  noting the changes—including environmental action and Hawaiian
                  sovereignty—that might remove the “stench of colonialism” and
                  inspire hope.

                  This is the museum wall label for artist Anicka Yi’s work,
                  <em>Your Hand Feels Like a Pillow That’s Been Microwaved</em>
                  (2015). This label, with its bizarre combination of items, is
                  characteristic of Yi’s wall texts, which read more like “alien
                  shopping lists” than descriptions of her works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn2" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This strange, list-style of labeling, however, fits with a key
                  interest of Yi: the world of smells. In particular, Yi’s
                  labels function like notes of a perfume, emphasizing the many
                  parts, seen or unseen, working together in her art pieces. I
                  will focus on these olfactory aspects of Yi’s art, selecting
                  key works that deal with smell and air. Namely, I am
                  interested in how Yi’s olfactory art centers intersections of
                  gender, race, and species to criticize a hegemonic obsession
                  with vision, cleanliness, and odorlessness, ultimately
                  building empathy for the marginalized and invisible. Like
                  Trask, Yi “rescents” the traditional olfactory narrative, as
                  she reclaims the physical medium of smell to upend derogatory
                  stereotypes, especially towards Asian women.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there are examples of olfactory art from the 20th
                  century, smell has been an especially potent medium for
                  contemporary artists to discuss themes of environmental risk,
                  feminism, immigration, memory, disease, and the non-human.
                  Interestingly, one of the main works that initiated questions
                  of transcorporeal, olfactory art did not intend to do so. This
                  was Ai Weiwei’s <em>Sunflower Seeds</em> (2010), a pile of
                  almost 100 million hand-painted ceramic sunflower seeds, which
                  the Tate Modern deemed too toxic to interact with because of
                  the risk of dust inhalation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn3" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  This instance demonstrates a key point of olfactory art, which
                  is that no matter how hard museums and the art world insist on
                  an exclusively visual relation between visitors and art, the
                  invisible, transcorporeal world still seeps through. Smell has
                  also permeated the art world despite its academic critics.
                  Immanuel Kant, for example, classified smell as the sense with
                  the least aesthetic potential because of its intimacy to the
                  body, subjectivity, and ephemerality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn4" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  In fact, it is these very characteristics that have made the
                  olfactory sense a fascinating subject for contemporary
                  artists.

                  There are many possible explanations for this recent turn to
                  smell. One, as argued by Hsuan Hsu in “Olfactory Art,
                  Transcorporeality, and the Museum Environment,” is that
                  olfactory art “activates museum air as an aesthetic medium and
                  highlights the manifold ways in which our bodies literally
                  incorporate that air,” making it a powerful avenue to resist
                  the separation of nature from the human and and showcase
                  environmental risk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn5" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  In this vein, Hsu also argues that the conservationist
                  approaches to art and nature work hand in hand, both framing
                  the environment as needing preservation from humans.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn6" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Olfactory art, however, defies this framing, using its
                  transcorporeal nature to showcase how humans intermingle with,
                  and ultimately are, their environments. Another reason
                  experimental artists have utilized smell is due to its ability
                  to encapsulate a particular time and space. For example,
                  Marcel Duchamp’s <em>50 cc of Paris Air</em> (1919) displayed
                  a glass ampoule containing nothing but Parisian air. By
                  putting forward air as his primary visual subject, Duchamp’s
                  work questions the idea that air is empty and links the
                  air—and its smell—to the environment and notions of place.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn7" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Olfactory art, in this way, possesses great potential as a
                  medium to explore themes of migration, geography, and cultural
                  identity. Additionally, olfactory art often brings to the
                  forefront elements that society would like to repress,
                  including disease and contagion. This is especially relevant
                  considering that miasma theory, which viewed “bad,” smelly air
                  as the agent of disease, was the norm in Europe until the late
                  nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn8" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Related to this weaponization of smell, groups such as women,
                  people of color, immigrants, workers, and non-humans have been
                  systematically discriminated against on the basis of scent.
                  Such discrimination underscores the fact that scents are
                  subjective, so any hierarchy of “good” or “bad” smells simply
                  reiterates the beliefs of institutional power structures.
                  However, contemporary artists like Anicka Yi have queered this
                  hierarchy, reclaiming and redefining smell in their own way to
                  support intersectional feminist discourses and recognize the
                  reparative potential of scent.

                <p>
                  In a <em>New Yorker</em> article on her interest in smells, Yi
                  wrote,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    “The smell of fermenting kimchi and doenjang seemed to sink
                    into our furniture, clothing, and hair. As a child, I often
                    felt ashamed of my family’s olfactory world. I wanted to
                    smell American, which I imagined would involve becoming
                    perfectly odorless.”
                    <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn9" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In this sense, Yi’s olfactory art has roots in her personal
                  background and identity as a Korean American woman. Yi, who
                  was born in Seoul but later migrated to Alabama and then
                  California, often discusses feeling invisible as a Korean
                  American in America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn10" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  It is interesting, in this way, that Yi has turned to scent,
                  which is also a trope of invisibility. Although Yi only began
                  making art in her mid-30s, she quickly appropriated her
                  fascination with smell into her art. Consequently, “Yi has
                  made air her primary material and subject."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn11" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In particular, Yi uses smell’s somatic and tangible qualities
                  to foreground a critique of structures in the art world and
                  broader society, which connect the gaze and odorlessness to
                  masculinity, whiteness, and power. Yi has explored the
                  repercussions of these power dynamics, asking, “How do we
                  imagine that immigrants, or foreigners, smell? Do we think of
                  the interiors of taxicabs, or Chinese takeout, or feet? As a
                  child, these questions horrified me, but as an artist I have
                  learned that there is power in finding the fascination that
                  lurks in that feeling.”
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn12" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By dissecting this feeling, Yi recovers smell as a way to
                  repair people’s relationships with one another and the world:
                  “I believe we’ve lost our empathic core because we’ve
                  neglected these other senses, like smell and touch and taste,”
                  Yi said.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn13" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Especially, smell can facilitate empathy because it
                  necessarily collapses the distance between the smeller and
                  smelled, drawing the audience closer and requiring
                  interaction. For Yi, this potential manifests in her focus on
                  cultivating empathy for (not exclusively) Asian and Asian
                  diaspora women, who have been systematically marginalized,
                  objectified, and dehumanized.

                <p>
                  In order to demonstrate this practice, I would like to begin
                  by analyzing <em>Tempura Fried Flowers</em>, a collection from
                  Yi’s 2022 exhibition in Seoul, <em>Begin Where You Are</em>.
                  Tempura fried flowers have been a repeating motif in Yi’s work
                  from her earliest exhibitions. One reason this pairing is
                  interesting derives from its clashing of scents, as Yi “upends
                  the usual odor sensations associated with fresh flowers: the
                  nosegay’s rosy fragrance is replaced by the unctuousness of
                  the wok.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn14" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Interestingly, both scents are tied to Asian women, who are
                  stereotypically associated with the feminine, “exotic”
                  fragrances of lotus/cherry blossoms and the greasy odors of
                  culinary labor. Thus, the hybridization of the tempura fried
                  flowers showcases the multifaceted and paradoxical imagination
                  of the Asian woman. The tempura flowers also symbolize a
                  liminal state between life and death, as if the flowers—often
                  representations of vitality—have been frozen in time by the
                  frying process, “suspended permanently in a process of
                  decay.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn15" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Some of the tempura flowers have also been placed in cardboard
                  boxes resembling tombs. According to English and gender
                  studies scholar Rachel Lee, this echoes the practice of
                  adorning burial sites with flowers to represent that “the
                  route taken by the metabolites of these blooms as they
                  volatilize mimics the airborne mode that a soul must travel in
                  going from the earthly to the spiritual realm.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn16" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  In this sense, Yi’s work deals fundamentally with the
                  invisible and transcorporeal, as symbolized through fragrance,
                  hybridity, and transformation.

                  Yi’s 2021 exhibition at the Tate Modern,
                  <em>In Love With the World</em>, builds on these themes with
                  an emphasis on human’s coexistence with machines. In this
                  exhibition, Yi has created what she calls an “aquarium of
                  machines” in the Turbine Hall, which float as jellyfish-like,
                  amoeba forms, programmed on artificial intelligence
                  software.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn17" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Inside the hall, Yi has included multiple scentscapes that
                  transition weekly. These smells are associated with specific
                  historical periods in Bankside, including marine scents of the
                  Precambrian period, plant smells from the Cretaceous period,
                  or spice fragrances used to treat the Black Death.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn18" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  These scentscapes reinforce the fact that we share, and have
                  always shared, our environments with many living and
                  non-living things, from dinosaurs to viruses. Specifically, Yi
                  is interested in a “politics of air,” and she conceives of air
                  as a “sculpture we inhabit” to highlight how “the space is not
                  empty but filled with the air we all share, and on which we
                  depend.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn19" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  In this way, <em>In Love With the World</em> decenters the
                  human, imagining a world of harmonious exchange with nature
                  and machines. Her use of olfactory and machine art also
                  challenges notions of what art is, and it is particularly
                  relevant that Yi has used scent in this space—the Tate Modern
                  in London—which is connected to power. “I talk a lot about how
                  power has no odor,” Yi said. “This is why you should not be
                  smelling any odors when you walk into a gallery in Chelsea, or
                  when you walk into a bank. These are places of power and
                  sterility, oftentimes associated with the masculine.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn20" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  By introducing smell to the Tate Modern, then, Yi acts as a
                  feminist intervention to the smell policing of patriarchal
                  institutions, exposing the idea that smell can be powerful in
                  its own right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the most crucial display of Yi’s exploration of smell
                  is her 2017 exhibition at The Guggenheim Museum,
                  <em>Life is Cheap</em>, which won the Hugo Boss Prize. This
                  exhibition followed the 2016 election of President Donald
                  Trump and explores themes related to this political climate.
                  <em>Immigrant Caucus</em>, for instance, conjures up migration
                  and borders. This work signals the entrance to the exhibition,
                  and it involves three pesticide canisters placed before an
                  iron gate, emitting a scent derived from the combination of
                  Asian American women and carpenter ants. According to Lee,
                  “While the canisters allude to late 19th and early 20th
                  century sanitary techniques of delousing the presumed ‘dirty’
                  immigrant at the Mexican border, Yi repurposes them in her
                  exhibit to diffuse a mist that rather than killing insects
                  might prime the viewer to the advantages of cross-border
                  contacts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn21" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  These canisters and their fragrance thus encourage a
                  hybridized perspective that values cultural diversity and
                  exchange. The other two works in this exhibition,
                  <em>Lifestyle Wars</em> and <em>Force Majeure</em>, display
                  the scent’s elements on opposite sides. Specifically,
                  <em>Lifestyle Wars</em> depicts a circuit board of real
                  carpenter ants as they travel through the tunnels, following
                  the same perfume from <em>Immigrant Caucus</em>. Reflecting on
                  why she chose to use ants, Yi said, “Ants fascinate me, with
                  their matriarchy, industry, and powerful sense of smell, which
                  they use to recognize the caste of other colony members,”
                  noting that ants are also the only species other than humans
                  that practice slavery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn22" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  Yi was also interested in ants because of their possible
                  association with Asian American women, as both are stereotyped
                  as hardworking and homogeneous.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn23" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  By drawing these women and ants together, and having the
                  audience literally stand between them, Yi encourages an
                  ecofeminist, multispecies empathy. Across from
                  <em>Lifestyle Wars</em> is <em>Force Majeur</em>, a powder
                  room of growing bacteria cultivated from women sampled in
                  Manhattan’s Chinatown and Koreatown neighborhoods (swabbed
                  from their cheeks and vaginas). Yi spotlights the formal
                  aspects of this bacteria, which grow in dynamic shapes and
                  colors on the plexiglass tiles. Lee argues that this artistic
                  quality reparatively embraces the notion of Asians as
                  “invaders”: it is as if Yi is saying, “yes, Asians are like
                  invading microbes and haven’t you noticed what great artists
                  they are?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn24" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>

                  These works from <em>Life is Cheap</em> are the clear
                  descendants of Yi’s exhibition,
                  <em>You Can Call Me F</em> (2015), which harnesses the potency
                  of bacteria and femininity to criticize institutional sexism.
                  In <em>Grabbing at Newer Vegetables</em>, Yi sampled cheek
                  swabs from 100 women in her social network, including many
                  female gallery owners in New York City, to spread and mutate
                  on agar with the titular words “You Can Call Me F.” This title
                  suggests femininity, as “F” may be a stand-in for “Female” or
                  “Feminine,” though the shortening also gives the work a
                  techno-futuristic feel. Over time, this title has been
                  obscured by the bacteria, and the smell of the samples, which
                  one visitor described as like “parmesan cheese or rancid
                  butter with sour floral accord up top,” grew stronger.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn25" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  For Yi, the desire to bring together women and create art from
                  their collective bacteria came from her personal experiences
                  with gender in the art world. In her words, “Women getting
                  together is seen as threatening, so it’s diminished into
                  something frivolous. I was frustrated that I wasn’t seeing
                  more females helping each other in this very aggressive,
                  competitive place in the art world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn26" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Building on this, Yi’s <em>Fontenelle</em> juxtaposes the
                  scent of the female collective with the imperceptible odor of
                  the Gagosian Gallery, one of the most prestigious contemporary
                  art galleries in the world. This friction between the female
                  bacterial network and the patriarchal gallery space becomes
                  manifested in motorcycle helmets, which diffuse the
                  combination of these scents into the gallery. In the art world
                  and beyond, Yi thus “aligns society’s growing paranoia around
                  contagion and hygiene (both public and private) with the
                  enduring patriarchal fear of feminism and potency of female
                  networks.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn27" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <figure id="f" class="q-figure q-figure--image">

                <p>
                  Yi’s work, then, underscores the prevailing strength of
                  femininity and female networks, as symbolized through
                  hybridized scents, carpenter ants, or multiplying bacteria, to
                  name a few. Despite society’s attempts to contain and control
                  smells and women, Yi’s art demonstrates how things always seep
                  in eventually, creating a beautiful, smelly, interwoven world.
                  Yi puts this simply: “There is nothing but ceaseless
                  porousness.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-01-scent-4-fn28" id="page-01-scent-4-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Smell, as a medium, wonderfully demonstrates this permeable
                  quality, and Yi masterfully uses it to cultivate empathy
                  through art. In doing so, Yi crafts a better future, one she
                  imagines will further redefine scent: “I’ve always thought of
                  my work as being on the precipice of a lot of discoveries that
                  happen with smell. The day when we can smell a jpeg is
                  probably just around the corner.”

                <p>
                  In <em>The Book of Salt</em>, Monique Truong weaves together
                  stories of diaspora to spotlight the trauma and abuse that
                  Empire has imposed on the subaltern. Primarily,
                  <em>Salt</em> tells the stories of three diasporic characters
                  who have traveled across oceans to live in Paris during the
                  1920s and 30s. These figures are Gertrude Stein and Alice B.
                  Toklas, based on their historical counterparts, and Bình,
                  their Vietnamese cook. Bình represents the countless
                  “nameless” Asians whose stories have long been ignored by the
                  Western literary canon. Far from nameless, however,
                  <em>Salt</em> deeply probes Bình’s character, exploring his
                  position at the nexus of race, sexuality, and class
                  identities. Told from Bình’s point of view in a reparative
                  manner, <em>Salt</em> invokes smell with abundant olfactory
                  and culinary language, as one might expect from a chef. In
                  this way, I argue that <em>Salt</em> effectively rewrites
                  <em>Fu-Manchu</em>’s olfactory logic by reclaiming the
                  perspective of the subaltern character from the “East” and
                  centering their sensory experience. Utilizing smell as a trope
                  of love and diasporic memory, Truong rejects the imperialist
                  notion that olfactory representations might only be used to
                  other. Instead, <em>Salt</em> makes space for a fragrant
                  healing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the context of a new <em>Fu-Manchu</em>, Bình represents an
                  interesting hybridization of characters. As a queer Asian man,
                  Bình exists in the margins, setting him apart from a white
                  masculinity that figures like Dr. Petrie or Nayland Smith
                  embody. This makes him similar to Fu-Manchu, who author and
                  playwright Frank Chin interprets as a “sexual joke, glorifying
                  white power”:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Fu, a man wearing a long dress, batting his eyelashes,
                    surrounded by muscular black servants in loin-cloths, and
                    with his bad habit of caressingly touching white men on the
                    leg, wrist, and face with his long fingernails, is not so
                    much a threat as he is a frivolous offense to white manhood.
                    (95-96)
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Dr. Fu’s emasculated and queered identity therefore
                  antagonizes him in <em>Fu-Manchu</em>, but in <em>Salt</em>,
                  Bình’s queerness is central to a story of desire and longing.
                  Additionally, Bình’s occupation as a cook is reminiscent of
                  Fu-Manchu’s expertise as a chemist. Again, then, Truong
                  reclaims what was weaponized in <em>Fu-Manchu</em>,
                  recognizing cooking and chemistry as sites for diasporic
                  creation and sustenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternatively, Bình might also be read as a revision of
                  Karamaneh’s character. For example, both are Asian laborers
                  who move between various “employers.” The texts focus on two
                  employment trinities, with Karamaneh serving Petrie and Smith
                  while Bình serves Stein and Toklas. Though Karamaneh and Bình
                  may enter the home space, such access is selective,
                  demonstrating their lower status. This is a reminder of Homi
                  Bhaba’s concept of “colonial mimicry,” as Karamaneh and Bình
                  reflect the Other “as a
                  <em>subject of difference who is almost the same, but not
                    quite</em>” (126). However, Bình is “not quite” Karamaneh either.
                  Unlike Karamaneh, who personifies the Orientalist fantasy of
                  absolute Oriental servitude, Bình serves whiteness with
                  rebellion, as his narration often renders Stein and Toklas as
                  ignorant rather than all-powerful. As a result,
                  <em>Salt</em> imagines a rewriting of <em>Fu-Manchu</em> in
                  which Karamaneh subversively criticizes those she serves.

                  Most pertinent to this project, Bình also resembles Fu-Manchu
                  and Karamaneh due to his “other” scent. As he attempts to find
                  a job, Bình laments, “I am accompanied by the stench of the
                  unemployable” (Truong 15). Here, the use of “stench” conveys
                  the strength and permanence of Bình’s joblessness, which
                  elicits social disdain and further prevents him from finding
                  work. Even when employed, though, smell still haunts Bình.
                  Especially, the Messieurs and Mesdames Bình works for “prefer
                  to believe that their cooks have no bodily needs, secretions,
                  not to mention excrement” though Bình counters, “we all do”
                  (64). By ignoring the bodily grotesque, these French employers
                  seek the impossible, unfairly punishing their laborers for
                  natural excretion. Thus, the French elite in <em>Salt</em> not
                  only discriminate against marginalized figures for “smelling
                  bad,” but simply for smelling like anything at all.

                  As part of such policing, the symbol of the sniffer dog
                  reappears in <em>Salt</em>, as in crime fiction texts. This
                  time it is Stein and Toklas’s dogs, Basket and Pépé, who
                  surveil Bình by his scent. When he gets drunk and throws up in
                  the Bilignin home, Bình believes the dogs’ “noses must have
                  been offended by the strong smell of alcohol that my vomit
                  released into the kitchen. I can imagine that their barking
                  then reached a particularly persuasive pitch” (141). In
                  alerting Stein and Toklas of Bình’s impropriety, the dogs use
                  scent as a means of control, affirming their status as
                  “supervisors” to the dehumanized cook. Like Basket and Pépé,
                  the chauffeur also attempts to control Bình. Notably, he
                  prescribes a “decreased intake of garlic, ginger, and other
                  ‘hot’ spices” as a “cure” for Bình’s “condition” of queerness
                  (128). The chauffeur’s idea that sexuality could be
                  medicalized as a symptom of sensory overload charts how the
                  senses (especially of smell and taste) can be degraded to
                  instill homophobia, racism, etc. Like Empire’s desire for
                  subaltern deodorization, the chauffeur calls for a repressed
                  diet in order to repress Bình’s homosexuality. This dual
                  “repression” backfires, however, as the spices actually become
                  symbols of queer desire, objects that, according to Bình, the
                  body “naturally craves” (128).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This theme of craving is an important element of
                  <em>Salt</em>; beyond the sexual, characters also crave
                  greater social status and the smells that come with it. Bình’s
                  maritime friend
                  <span class="mark">Bão, for instance, compares ships and explains that he
                    prefers the <em>Latouche Tréville</em> to the
                    <em>Niobe</em>. Though Bão never says why,</span>
                  Bình postulates that it was the luxurious fragrances that drew
                  <span class="mark">Bão</span> in:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <span class="mark">Bão, I imagined, liked being so close to luxury, so
                      intimate with its smells, the rumpled linens loaded in his
                      arms, lavender-scented still by the fresh-bathed bodies of
                      women whom he would never meet, the perfume and cigar
                      smoke still dancing in the air as he mopped the decks
                      clean at three in the morning…like all servants he
                      <em>had</em> to take solace from wealth and pleasure, even
                      if they were not his own. (108)</span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">For subaltern characters like Bão, then, smell allows a
                    momentary social transgression, an imagination of what it
                    would be like to live in the upper echelon of society and be
                    surrounded by its scents. By the same token, characters
                    avoid the smell of the impoverished: “No one wants to stand
                    so close to desperation. It is too thick in the air. It is
                    naturally invasive, has the dank odor of musty rooms and
                    vacant houses, a distinct taste, tangy and burning on the
                    tongue” (220). The determination of class, thus, relies on a
                    multisensory playbook, distinguishing the “dank odor” of
                    poverty from “lavender-scented” luxury. With odors acting as
                    class indicators, these two instances reflect how smells
                    instigate a push and pull—attracting people towards the
                    scent of wealth and propelling them from that of scarcity.
                    Bình in particular is attracted to a white-passing Black man
                    named Marcus Lattimore. Unlike Bình’s, Lattimore’s fragrance
                    helps him to blend in, as “Miss Toklas approved of the scent
                    of bay and lime on [his] skin. Like a Frenchman, she
                    thought, announcing himself even before he enters the room,
                    making an impression even after he is gone” (38). Perhaps
                    what Bình desires most is for smell to help him achieve such
                    “passing.” Then, his smell might fool others into believing
                    he belongs, even if he does not think so himself.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">However, characters like Bình and Bão never realize the
                    status they desire, as Truong forgoes the goal of cultural
                    assimilation for one of imperialist undoing; by taking the
                    subaltern perspective and centering smells/foods,
                    <em>Salt</em> ultimately challenges the hegemony of Empire
                    by discrediting its sensory order. As the abundant olfactory
                    language above suggests, the text disrupts a dominant
                    hierarchy of senses by prioritizing subaltern olfaction. In
                    fact, it is scent that inspires Bình’s realization that his
                    lover Lattimore (Sweet Sunday Man) has left him: “I know by
                    the smells. Fresh paint and fresh air can mean only one
                    thing” (236). For Bình, smells denote truth and
                    understanding, conveying olfaction’s value. Moreover, in
                    <em>Salt</em>’s hierarchy of the senses, smell seems to
                    overcome sight. At one point, Lattimore tells Bình that “of
                    the five senses, the one that he most distrusts is our
                    ability to see. It is the one most easily fooled” (236).
                    Lattimore’s profession as an iridologist, one who uses the
                    eyes to assess a patient’s health, further supports the
                    shortcomings of vision. Though this practice does elevate
                    the eyes as “windows” to a person’s health, it also points
                    to them as signs of disease and bodily fragility. By
                    corrupting the eyes, Truong protests Empire’s historic
                    privileging of sight as the superior sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">The trope of food in <em>Salt</em> builds on this attack of
                    imperialist sensory hegemony to critique colonialism.
                    Because the text tracks the stories of various cooks, it is
                    no surprise that food, its taste and smell, holds power.
                    Bình’s brother, Anh Minh or “Minh the Sous Chef,” recounts
                    one particular story of a chef’s rebellion:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <span class="mark">After all, the <em>chef de cuisine</em> at the
                      Continental Palace Hotel in Saigon—a man who claimed to be
                      from Provence but was rumored to be the illegitimate son
                      of a high-ranking French official and his Vietnamese
                      seamstress—had to be dismissed because he was serving
                      dishes obscured by lemongrass and straw mushrooms. He also
                      slipped pieces of rambutan and jackfruit into the sorbets.
                      “The clientele demanded that the natives in the kitchen be
                      immediately dismissed if not jailed, shocked that the
                      culprit was a harmless-looking ‘Provencal’ incensed enough
                      to threaten closure of the most fashionable hotel in all
                      of Indochina.” (42-43)</span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">In this case, the <em>chef de cuisine</em> reclaims his
                    labor by breaking boundaries and sneaking traditionally
                    Vietnamese foods/herbs into the Continental Palace Hotel, a
                    glaring monument to French colonialism and tourism. This
                    anecdote engages with Truong’s larger point that the
                    subversion of Empire employs foods and scents. Especially,
                    smell’s ability to “threaten closure” of the hotel signifies
                    olfaction as an engine of subaltern might—capable of
                    “closing” Empire.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Food also functions more figuratively in <em>Salt</em>. For
                    Bình, learning the language of the colonizer feels like he
                    had been “born with [French words] in my mouth, as if they
                    were the seeds of a sour fruit someone else ate and then
                    ungraciously stuffed its remains into my mouth” (11-12).
                    Truong thus calls upon food metaphors to critique linguistic
                    imperialism as coercive and ultimately not sustainable.
                    Wenying Xu quotes this metaphor in “Sexuality, Colonialism,
                    and Ethnicity in Monique Truong’s
                    <em>The Book of Salt</em> and Mei Ng’s
                    <em>Eating Chinese Food Naked</em>” and details its symbolic
                    nuance:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <span class="mark">Truong’s brilliant metaphor offers a precise picture of
                      the hideous coercion in the name of civilizing the Other.
                      The seeds planted so “ungraciously” in the colonized
                      sprout vines and branches to crowd out and suffocate
                      indigenous cultural consciousness. In time these seeds are
                      bound to bear “sour fruit” of racial grief. (140)</span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Xu draws attention to how the “seed” metaphor works to
                    convey the prolonged consequences of colonial rule, noting
                    that imperialism brings grief and melancholia past Empire’s
                    departure. The metaphor also functions reparatively, though.
                    While Bình mourns the struggle of knowing little French, as
                    his vocabulary is mostly limited to that of culinary labor,
                    he resourcefully uses this culinary focus to inspire food
                    metaphors that attack the colonizer. Pigeon-holed in a
                    French-ruled society, Bình embraces the pigeons.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Most importantly, it is Bình’s sense of smell that allows
                    him to survive, love, and remember what he has left behind.
                    By reclaiming olfactory language to support Bình’s diasporic
                    journey, Truong asserts smell as a vital sense on a personal
                    scale—it is inextricable from the subaltern individual’s
                    story of healing. Starting on a basic level, smell supports
                    Bình’s livelihood. As a cook, a strong sense of smell is
                    essential, so Bình’s olfaction likely finances his career
                    and promotes his survival as an immigrant. Gertrude Stein
                    agrees that one needs a sense of smell to cook, and even
                    more, she blames her own olfaction for preventing her from
                    becoming a doctor. Stein, who would “would rather drink a
                    glass of spoiled milk than bother to smell it beforehand,”
                    claims that “one must possess a keen sense of smell in order
                    to identify and, more importantly, to distinguish among the
                    odors emitted from the body during its varying stages of
                    decay” (181, 180). In medical school, these smells haunt
                    Stein, “combining all her patient’s beastly odors into a
                    solid wall of filth and stink, a wall that she was
                    absolutely unwilling to breach” (180). Stein’s refusal to
                    deal with such odors reflects an imperialist need for
                    deodorization, and in this case, this desire emerges as a
                    weakness. Therefore, Bình’s superior olfaction, and his
                    willingness to smell, proves Bình eclipses Stein on some
                    level. Scent, then, protects Bình and his attempt to survive
                    despite marginalization. Smell aids other characters, too,
                    like the blind vendor who sells pungent vegetables. Bình
                    shares that it is “no coincidence that this man sells what
                    he does. With onions and garlic, he can protect himself from
                    thieves, because he can always smell them walking away”
                    (62). It is also “no coincidence” that Bình cooks—this work
                    gratifies Bình’s smell to nourish his professional status
                    and ultimately empower him.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Beyond such survival, smell permits love, adorning the
                    romantic and sensual moments in <em>Salt</em> with
                    fragrance. In Truong’s world, smell and pleasure are
                    entangled, and the scent of the truffle symbolizes this
                    intersection. According to Bình, “the truffle is a gift for
                    the nose. Pleasure refined into a singular scent, almost
                    animal, addictive, a lover’s body coming towards yours on a
                    moonless night” (210). Particularly, the setting of a
                    “moonless night” evokes a landscape of darkness, allowing
                    scent to come to the forefront as the sense of love and
                    lovemaking. Truong especially details the smells of queer
                    desire from the narration of Bình. As mentioned earlier,
                    Bình identifies his lover by the smell of lime and bay. As
                    Bình and Lattimore have sex, Bình appreciates his smell:
                    “Your body comes close, and the scent of lime and bay is all
                    around us” (146). Smell, in this way, denotes the sensual,
                    as the mingling scents symbolize the couple’s sexual uniting
                    and queer love. Interestingly, queerness pairs well with
                    olfactory symbolism, perhaps due to smell’s marginalized
                    status and transgressive qualities—scent breaks “rules,”
                    just as queer lovers do.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Themes of love and smell also appear when Bình recounts the
                    story of how his mother and likely biological father met. In
                    this encounter, foods and smells are prominent. Candied
                    lotus seeds, for example, “sweetened their first sighs of
                    love” (170). Additionally, when Bình’s mother becomes
                    pregnant, “her hair grew thick, shiny with oil, and smelled
                    of the fresh orange peels that she used to mist her comb”
                    (170). In these instances, Truong connects romantic and
                    maternal love to a sweet scent. Furthermore, Truong uses
                    seed imagery of flowers and fruits to describe this smell,
                    adapting her earlier metaphor of the seeds of colonialism to
                    proclaim the seeds of love in a reparative manner. Love
                    therefore burgeons, fruiting like a seed to incorporate
                    multiple senses. This agrees with Bình’s answer when Stein
                    asks him to define love. Love is <em>not</em> something, he
                    says, “seen but untouched”—it is smelled too (40).</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">In this manner, Bình’s appreciation of scent distinguishes
                    him from the Old Man, his abusive, alcoholic father. The Old
                    Man often devalues smell, especially despising the smell of
                    women. In reference to “women with bulging money belts and a
                    willingness to embrace whatever gods necessary,” Bình
                    recounts that the Old Man “could not stand the sight of
                    them, the smell of them” (201). The Old Man thus highlights
                    how scent and gender intersect, as scent may be applied to
                    reinforce misogyny. Additionally, when the Old Man and
                    Bình’s mother sleep together, the Old Man attempts to
                    dissolve his sense of smell, removing the “sense” from the
                    “sensual.” In particular, the Old Man “had to touch this
                    girl who smelled like the only woman he had ever loved. It
                    sickened him each time. He committed the act quickly and
                    without ever closing his eyes” (201). In this instance, the
                    Old Man upholds a hegemonic hierarchy of the senses, making
                    sure to keep his vision while degrading olfaction as
                    “sickening.” For the Old Man, vision protects and sustains
                    his power. At the same time, however, Bình’s mother “kept
                    her eyes close” and she thinks to herself, “He can make me
                    open my legs, but never my eyes” (201). In this way, it is
                    the <em>absence</em> of sight that empowers Bình’s mother,
                    as this allows her to dissociate from the pain and reaffirm
                    her bodily autonomy in a moment of vulnerability. The
                    senses, then, in <em>Salt</em> hold vastly different
                    purposes for each character, sometimes spurring love and
                    other times protecting from love’s lack.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Beyond love, Truong emphasizes the powerful connection
                    between scent and memory. For Bình, aromas create a thread
                    to his “origins” despite diaspora, tying him to Vietnam by
                    triggering memories of it while in Paris. For example, when
                    Bình receives an envelope from his brother, he first sniffs
                    it, noting that “It smelled of a faraway city, pungent with
                    anticipation for rain” (5). The faraway city here is Saigon,
                    and it is scent that is primary, before vision, in this
                    moment of diasporic memory. The smell of food, in
                    particular, draws Bình to memories of his homeland. When
                    Bình shares a meal with the enigmatic “man on the bridge” in
                    Paris, smells of Vietnam abound: “When we opened our mouths
                    to speak, the night air became scented with cinnamon,” and
                    again, “the aroma of cinnamon, unmistakable and insistent,
                    especially when coupled with sugar and heat, surrounded us”
                    (99). In this instance, the fragrance of cinnamon becomes
                    all-pervasive, taking over the French air. Cinnamon here may
                    symbolize Vietnam, as it is an essential spice in Vietnamese
                    cuisine, flavoring the broth of phở, for example. It is
                    interesting that the dish here is apple pie, often
                    considered a quintessential American dessert. But the
                    cinnamon in this dessert comes from South and Southeast
                    Asia, a product of colonialism. Truong, therefore,
                    complicates the origins of apple pie, connecting it to
                    Bình’s own origins in Vietnam. During this meal, the diners
                    also encounter the scents of morel mushrooms, “hidden below
                    the haricots verts until their aromas gave them away,” and
                    watercress, “unmistakable, bitter in the mouth, cooling in
                    the body, greens that any Vietnamese could identify with his
                    eyes closed” (97). Xu proposes that this watercress
                    represents the struggles of Vietnamese people:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <span class="mark">Watercress is a vegetable that evokes the diners’ love of
                      and longing for their homeland, a vegetable that conjures
                      up the aroma and taste of the flooded land of Vietnam. At
                      a symbolic level, this vegetable also stands for the
                      people of Vietnam, who are misunderstood and overpowered
                      by their colonizers. (Xu 146)</span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Xu further extends this metaphor, describing how watercress
                    rebels when overwhelmed by heat, turning into ropes that are
                    impossible to swallow. Truong, then, suggests that the
                    Vietnamese refuse to be ruled by colonists, displaying
                    fervent anti-imperialist sentiment via culinary metaphor. In
                    such a way, foods, and their scents, anchor Bình to Vietnam
                    and Vietnamese affect. As Xu delineates, “Memories of exile
                    are often evoked by kitchen activities, the partition
                    between past and present rendered porous by food, smells,
                    and tastes” (136). Thus, smells in <em>Salt</em> blur
                    boundaries of time and place through recollection and
                    remembering.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the olfactory sense inspires memory of Bình’s mother,
                  bringing them together across the physical distance of oceans
                  and the metaphorical distances of time and death. Scent
                  engulfs Bình’s relationship with his mother, even from its
                  conception: Bình remembers, “Before my mother could take me
                  into her arms, I smelled her. Before I could take in my
                  mother’s milk, I tasted the salt on her nipple” (217). In this
                  way, it is the senses of smell and taste that dominate Bình’s
                  first memories of his mother. Specifically, Bình’s mother
                  smells like oranges, the scent of the “fresh orange peels that
                  she used to mist her comb” when pregnant with Bình. As Bình
                  says goodbye to his mother when departing Vietnam, he “kissed
                  her cheeks, taking the time to smell the oranges in her hair”
                  (175). The citrusy fragrance holds multifaceted memories for
                  Bình, then, reminding him of his mother, but also their
                  separation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The smells of cooking also remind Bình of his mother, as he
                  grew up cooking with her in the kitchen. One particular
                  memory, when Bình was nine years old, is of cutting vegetables
                  with his mother, his “fingers, face, hair, stinking of raw
                  scallions” (72). This memory is also of the first time that
                  Bình cut himself with a kitchen knife, bleeding into his food,
                  which becomes a habit over time. Doing so reminds Bình of his
                  mother. He feels, when the cut is deep enough, “there is an
                  ache that fools my heart. Tricks it into a false memory of
                  love lost to a wide open sea. I say to myself, ‘Ah, this
                  reminds me of you’” (74). The pain of the cut, for Bình,
                  cannot be separated from the memory of his mother. As Xu
                  notes, “Bình cuts himself to remember his mother, who is the
                  only love in his loveless world, and this comfort of recalling
                  her love is associated with pain” (142). Such bleeding also
                  initiates a boundary crisis, excreting subaltern bodily fluids
                  into the social system, just as white imperialists worried
                  about. Yet this time, Truong reclaims the blurred lines from
                  the subaltern perspective: this permeability is a tool for
                  subaltern remembrance, enabling Bình to cross the sea and
                  return to his lost mother. As Bình records these memories,
                  <em>Salt</em> transforms into a memorial for his mother, who
                  is revealed to be deceased later on in the text. Smells
                  feature fundamentally in this memorial, scenting the bond
                  between mother and child indelibly.

                  <span class="mark">Therefore, <em>The Book of Salt</em> rewrites
                    <em>Fu-Manchu</em>, developing scent as a medium for
                    marginalized characters to live, love, and hold on to
                    diasporic memories. This last section, on memory, introduces
                    scent as a bridge between past and present, one crossed by
                    those in the Asian diaspora to remember that on the other
                    side. I am reminded of Ocean Vuong’s
                    <em>On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</em> when discussing
                    Bình’s relationship with his mother. Writing in the form of
                    a letter from son to mother, Vuong shares:</span>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In Vietnamese, the word for missing someone and remembering
                    them is the same: nhớ. Sometimes, when you ask me over the
                    phone, <em>Có nhớ mẹ không?</em> I flinch, thinking you
                    meant, <em>Do you remember me?</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="mark">I miss you more than I remember you. (186)</span>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <span class="mark">Vuong’s questions confront the separation of the verbs “to
                    miss” and “to remember” in the English language. Where does
                    missing end and remembering begin? Since Vietnamese is also
                    Bình’s native language, perhaps Bình’s grief expresses the
                    word <em>nhớ</em> as a hybridization of longing and
                    remembrance as well. Memory, thus, is muddled: hybrid,
                    subjective, and smelly. And memory, it is important to note,
                    is necessary to overthrowing Empire—how can one cast away
                    what has been forgotten? In the fall, I will write the next
                    chapter of this project, “Fish,” which will explore memory
                    in greater detail, examining recollection from an ecological
                    perspective with consideration of the nonhuman world and its
                    odors.</span>

                  I am so grateful for the entire staff at Getty Publications,
                  who welcomed me into the department and provided me with
                  valuable lessons, thoughtful conversations, and yummy snacks
                  during Tea at 3. Thank you very much to my supervisors, Erin
                  Dunigan and Darryl Oliver, for their kindness. During my
                  interview, they asked me what makes a good mentor, and I think
                  they both have truly embodied the answer. Thank you also to
                  Layla, who has been a source of support and a lovely friend
                  throughout our internship. Thank you to the Goldsmith Adams
                  Research Fund and the Office of Student Fellowships and
                  Research at Bowdoin for making this research possible. Also, a
                  huge thank you to my mentor and research advisor, Belinda, for
                  all the encouragement, insights, and shared sashimi along the
                  way. Lastly, thank you to my family, whose stories inspired
                  this project and whose love has nourished it throughout.
